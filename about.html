        <h1>Birth of the company and its name</h1>

            <p>    Automobile company Wanderer was originally established in 1885, later becoming a branch of Audi AG. Another company, NSU, 
                which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later supplied the chassis for Gottlieb Daimler's 
                four-wheeler. After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in 
                Zwickau on 16 July 1909, his second company, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH. His former partners sued him for 
                trademark infringement. The German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) in Leipzig, eventually determined that the 
                Horch brand belonged to his former company.</p>

           <p>Audi started with a 2,612 cc inline-four engine model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model, as well as 4,680 cc and 5,720 cc 
               models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. The first six-cylinder model Type M, 4,655 cc appeared in 1924.
               August Horch left the Audiwerke in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport, but he was still involved with
                Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921, Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present 
                a production car, the Audi Type K, with left-handed drive.[23] Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during 
                the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer when driving on the right.</p>
